I designed this website for people who are looking for more informations and about Ireland such us population, density etc.
They can choose county as well.  All information are showed in the most understandable and clear way by graphs and pie charts. Dashboard is Mobile First Designed.

Project design created in Balsamiq mockups 3 is located in main folder 

#### The Project Brief:
##### CREATE A DATA DASHBOARD

* Build a data dashboard that visualizes a dataset of your choice
* Your data can be stored locally (e.g., in a js,csv file) or sourced from an API
* Visualise your data using D3.js and dc.js



## Features
Dashboard contains 5 chart boxes:
1. Population pie chart by country 
2. Population pie chart by county 
3. Number displays with total population and by gender
4. Stack chart with age groups by county
5. Density bar chart by county

Beside that there are 2 selectors to choose country and county and reset button to refresh data.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML5 - Valid HTML structure
2. CSS3 - Styling for page
3. Javascript - makes website interactive, helps in building readable charts
4. D3.js- library for visualizing large data sets
5. DC.js - Javascript charting library with native crossfilter support, allowing highly efficient exploration on large multi-dimensional datasets in this case csv file
6. Crossfilter - JavaScript library for exploring large multivariate datasets
7. [Font Awsome](https://fontawesome.com/) - buttons icons

9. JQUERY - scroll effect.
10. [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)- plugin which add vendor prefixes for different browsers
11. Balsamic Mockups 3 - to create mockup
